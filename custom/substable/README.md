# Stable

This is the Stable theme from Drupal 8. This version of Stable is deprecated in
Drupal 9, and removed in Drupal 10. From Drupal 10 onward, themes that use
Drupal 8's Stable as a base theme will require this contrib theme. 

Stable does not need to be enabled in order for themes to use it as a base
theme. Its presence in the themes directory is all that is needed for themes
depending on it.
